# get-NBA
This is the Capstone-1 project for Springboard Software Engineering Course.

API that I am using: https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1

# User Flow
1. You'll need to sign up or log in to enjoy the features.
2. After logging in, users can search for a NBA player by providing his first and last name. If a player is found, the APP would return his career stats.
3. In the career stats page, user can do an advanced search by providing the name of the player, a time frame from start_date to end_date, and searching criteria on stats.
    For example:
    If you want to know the games that "Allen Iverson" scored more than or equal to 50 points between Feb 1, 2000 and June-30-2008, you should enter "Allen" in the first name field, "Iverson" in the last name field, "2000-2-1" in the start date field, "2008-6-30" in the end date field and "50" in the points field.
