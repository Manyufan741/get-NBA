# get-NBA
This is the Capstone-1 project for Springboard Software Engineering Course.

API that I am using: https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1

# User Flow
1. You'll need to sign up or log in to enjoy the features.
2. After logging in, users can search for a NBA player by providing his first and last name. If a player is found, the APP would return his career stats.
3. In the career stats page, user can do an advanced search by providing the name of the player, a time frame from start_date to end_date, and searching criteria on stats.
    For example:
    If you want to know the games' stats of "Allen Iverson" scoring more than or equal to 50 points between Feb 1, 2000 and June 30, 2008, you should enter "Allen" in the Player First Name field, "Iverson" in the Player Last Name field, "2000-2-1" in the Starting Date field, "2008-6-30" in the End Date field and "50" in the Points field.
